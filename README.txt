Marines vs Monsters for Zandronum

Currently in an alpha state. Only three monsters are playable. 

Monsters spawn as ghosts (like Left 4 Dead Special Infected in versus) where they can pick their position to spawn near the enemy marine players.

As of now, ghost monsters can spawn almost whereever. It will eventually be restricted to out of sight of marine players.
